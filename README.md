### Contextualization:
The data used in this report was retrived from KAGGLE: https://www.kaggle.com/c/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction  
Each data example consists of a protein sequence, a pH value and thermostability index. Predicting the thermostability is fundamental in enzyme engeneering for a wide variety of applications. Employing ML techniques is of great value to achieve the latter purpose as it saves time and money.

### Preprocessing: 
* Data processing
* Identification of the train and test datasets
* Treatment of Missing values

### Feature Extraction
* Identification of the Descriptors with BioPython and ProPy

### Exploratory Analysis
* Outlier Treatment (dependent variable)
* Standardization
* Thermostability value distribution 
* Correlation Analysis (Pearson, Spearman, f_regression, mutual_information)

### Unsupervised Learning
* PCA
* tSNE
* K-means

### Supervised Learning
* Cross-validation
* Hyper-parameter tuning
* Model Selection

### Deep learning
* MLP
* CNN
