### [Contextualization](https://github.com/vaniamiguel13/SIB/blob/main/C_P_FE.ipynb):
The data used in this report was retrived from KAGGLE: https://www.kaggle.com/c/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction  
Each data example consists of a protein sequence, a pH value and thermostability index. Predicting the thermostability is fundamental in enzyme engeneering for a wide variety of applications. Employing ML techniques is of great value to achieve the latter purpose as it saves time and money.

### [Preprocessing](https://github.com/vaniamiguel13/SIB/blob/main/C_P_FE.ipynb): 
* Data processing
* Identification of the train and test datasets
* Treatment of Missing values

### [Feature Extraction](https://github.com/vaniamiguel13/SIB/blob/main/C_P_FE.ipynb)
* Identification of the Descriptors with BioPython and ProPy

### [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/vaniamiguel13/SIB/blob/main/AE.ipynb)
* Outlier Treatment (dependent variable)
* Standardization
* Thermostability value distribution 
* Correlation Analysis (Pearson, Spearman, f_regression, mutual_information)
* Multicollinearity Analysis

### [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/vaniamiguel13/SIB/blob/main/UL.ipynb)
